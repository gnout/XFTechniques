Techniques for Xamarin.Forms

## NuGet Packages

* [Acr.UserDialogs 7.0.4](https://github.com/aritchie/userdialogs) - All Projects

## Custom Controls (Set 01)

### Custom Control Behaviors (Example 01)

Attache a behavior to a custom control. The behavior just checks if the entry contains a valid decimal number. If not, the it turns the font of the entry in red color.  
The idea is based on the `stackoverflow` question that can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56986754/xamarin-forms-how-to-add-behaviors-to-custom-control)

## Various NuGet Packages (Set 02)

### ACR User Dialogs (Example 02)

Very easy way to create dialogs and especially __loading__ screens. One thing to remember is that dialogs cannot be inside loading screens.
